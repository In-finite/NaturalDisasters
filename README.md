# Real Time Tracking:
This part of the project gives a track of all the earthquakes happened in the past hour, in the past 24 hours and last week. The points are plotted on a map. Based on the magnitude of the earthquake the colour changes.
It works based on the user's input and has very simple user interface. The working can be seen below.

Adding video soon
