# Real Time Tracking:
This part of the project gives a track of all the earthquakes happened in the past hour, in the past 24 hours and last week. The points are plotted on a map. Based on the magnitude of the earthquake the colour changes.
It works based on the user's input and has very simple user interface. The working can be seen below.
